# TaskApp
 To do directory:
 basic task app with the ability to add a task, remove a task, print all the tasks, print to a file as well as read the file. 

main contains a simple options menu as well as a read and writing method. 

The file contains a task object, a collection class for the task object which is implemented by using a List (Specifially an Array list), a Scanner class, and a Tasks.txt file to  store the data. 

to do application directory:
the same as the to do app just updated with javaFx and a nice blue GUI
